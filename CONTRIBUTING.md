## Env setup

This package uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) for package management.

If you haven't installed yet, install it with the following command.

```bash
npx pnpm add -g pnpm
```

And `pnpm install` brings dependencies into node_modules way faster than npm.

## New bindings

This project also attempts to provide a collection of ink-community components/hooks.

If any useful Ink components/hooks that don't have binding yet, please submit an issue or PR!

## Help to improve the quality of bindings

Maintainer(Hyeseong) is new to ReasonML. If you have any idea how to write bindings effectively or improve API in ReasonML style, suggestions are will be appreciated.
