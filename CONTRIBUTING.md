## Env setup

This package uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) for package management.

If you haven't installed yet, install it with the following command.

```bash
npx pnpm add -g pnpm
```

And `pnpm install` brings dependencies into node_modules way faster than npm.

## New bindings

This project also attempts to provide a collection of ink-community components/hooks.

If any useful Ink components/hooks that don't have binding yet, please submit an issue or PR!

## Help to improve the quality of bindings

If you have any idea how to write bindings effectively or improve API in ReScript style, suggestions are will be appreciated.
